# Phase 1 Transition Report: Orion → Rune

**Date:** August 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Duration:** Initial setup session  
**Author:** Claude Code + Brandon Aron

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the Orion to Rune platform transition. This phase focused on establishing the foundational git structure and package architecture for the new AI orchestration platform while preserving the existing Orion codebase.

## Objectives Achieved

### ✅ Git Infrastructure Setup
- **New Development Branch**: Created `rune-main` branch for all future development
- **Legacy Preservation**: 
  - Tagged current state as `orion-final`
  - Created `orion-legacy` branch for reference
  - Established clean separation between old and new codebases

### ✅ Package Architecture Transformation
- **Legacy Migration**: Moved core Orion packages to `archive/orion-legacy/`
  - `planner-llm` → Archived (will become enhanced rune)
  - `task-parser` → Archived (will become Google Tasks connector)
  - `calendar-parser` → Archived (will become calendar connector)

- **New Package Structure**: Created 6 core Rune packages
  - `@rune/rune-core` - Main orchestration engine
  - `@rune/rune-providers` - AI provider abstraction layer
  - `@rune/rune-runtime` - Workflow execution runtime
  - `@rune/rune-marketplace` - Sharing and monetization platform
  - `@rune/runestone` - Workflow library management
  - `@rune/rune-web` - Web interface and UI

### ✅ Configuration Updates
- **Root Package**: Rebranded from "orion" to "rune" with updated description
- **Scope Management**: All packages use consistent `@rune/` namespace
- **Keywords**: Updated to reflect AI orchestration focus
- **Scripts**: Maintained workspace compatibility

## Technical Details

### Repository Structure
```
├── archive/orion-legacy/          # Preserved Orion packages
│   ├── planner-llm/
│   ├── task-parser/
│   └── calendar-parser/
├── packages/                      # New Rune packages
│   ├── rune-core/
│   ├── rune-providers/
│   ├── rune-runtime/
│   ├── rune-marketplace/
│   ├── runestone/
│   └── rune-web/
└── docs/reports/                  # Documentation
```

### Package Configuration
Each new package includes:
- Proper `@rune/` scoping
- TypeScript build configuration
- Vitest testing setup
- Consistent metadata (author, license, keywords)

## Migration Mapping

| Orion Package | Status | Rune Equivalent | Migration Strategy |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `@orion/core` | Retained | `@rune/rune-core` | Refactor orchestration logic |
| `@orion/planner-llm` | Archived | Enhanced rune | Convert to workflow component |
| `@orion/task-parser` | Archived | Connector | Generalize as Google Tasks connector |
| `@orion/calendar-parser` | Archived | Connector | Generalize as calendar connector |
| `@orion/web` | Retained | `@rune/rune-web` | Complete redesign |
| `@orion/cli` | Retained | Future enhancement | Adapt for rune operations |
| `@orion/mcp-client` | Retained | `@rune/rune-runtime` | Enhance for sandboxing |

## Preserved Assets

### Code Preservation
- All Orion functionality maintained in `archive/orion-legacy/`
- Git tags ensure point-in-time recovery
- Existing packages (`orion-core`, `web`, `cli`, etc.) remain functional

### Configuration Preservation
- Original `orion.config.json` (to be renamed to `rune.config.json`)
- Database schemas and migrations
- Development scripts and tooling

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2: Web Interface & Design System
- Visual workflow editor components
- Marketplace interface mockups
- Design system establishment
- Rune builder UI development

## Risk Mitigation Achieved

- **Zero Data Loss**: All original code preserved and accessible
- **Rollback Capability**: Can return to Orion state via git branches/tags
- **Incremental Development**: New architecture built alongside existing system
- **Workspace Compatibility**: Maintained npm workspace structure

## Metrics

- **Files Moved**: 3 core packages to archive
- **New Packages Created**: 6 Rune packages
- **Configuration Files Updated**: 7 package.json files
- **Git Branches Created**: 2 (rune-main, orion-legacy)
- **Git Tags Created**: 1 (orion-final)

## Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully establishes the technical foundation for the Rune platform while preserving all existing Orion functionality. The new package architecture aligns with the hub-and-spokes design pattern outlined in the transition plan, setting up clear separation of concerns for the AI orchestration platform.

The transition maintains development velocity by preserving working systems while enabling parallel development of the new Rune architecture. All objectives for Phase 1 have been met on schedule.
