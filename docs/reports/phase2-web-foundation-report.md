### Design System Elements

**Dark Theme Color Palette:**
- Background: Slate-900 (primary background)
- Surface: Slate-800 (cards, header)
- Text: Slate-100 (primary text), Slate-400 (secondary text)
- Action Colors: Blue-400, Green-400, Purple-400, Orange-400
- Borders: Slate-700 (subtle borders and dividers)

*Note: This is a temporary color scheme while we develop the final Rune branding and visual identity.*

**Component Patterns:**
- **QuickActionCard**: Dark slate backgrounds with colored borders and hover effects
- **Layout System**: Max-width containers, responsive grid with dark theme
- **Typography**: Inter font, high contrast text for accessibility

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Desktop: 4-column grid for quick actions

### Technology Upgrade Process

**Migration Challenges Resolved:**
- **Workspace Conflicts** - Bypassed npm workspace interference for clean upgrade
- **Peer Dependency Issues** - Resolved React 19 + Next.js 15 compatibility
- **CSS Class Errors** - Fixed Tailwind configuration for production builds

**Build Verification:**
- ✅ Development server: `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ Production build: All pages static generated
- ✅ ESLint: No warnings or errors
- ✅ TypeScript: Strict checking passed

## User Experience Design

### Home Panel Layout

**Hero Section:**
- Clear value proposition: "Create, share, and execute AI workflows"
- Professional typography with centered layout

**Quick Actions Grid:**
- Visual icons with color coding for each action type
- Hover effects and clear call-to-action design
- Descriptive text for each workflow type

**Dashboard Section:**
- Status metrics: Runes cast, created, credits remaining
- Clean card layout with numerical emphasis
- Placeholder data showing infinite credits (beta status)

### Navigation Flow

**User Journey Mapping:**
1. **Landing** → Home panel overview
2. **Discovery** → Browse runes in marketplace
3. **Creation** → Build custom workflows
4. **Management** → Access personal runestone library
5. **Execution** → Cast workflows with real-time feedback

## Performance Metrics

### Build Statistics
```
Route (app)                    Size    First Load JS
├ ○ /                         3.45 kB    103 kB
├ ○ /cast                     132 B      99.8 kB

## Design System Foundation

### Established Patterns

**Dark Theme Color System:**
```javascript
// Primary backgrounds and surfaces
slate-900: '#0f172a',  // Main background
slate-800: '#1e293b',  // Card/header background
slate-700: '#334155',  // Borders and dividers

// Text and content
slate-100: '#f1f5f9',  // Primary text
slate-400: '#94a3b8',  // Secondary text

// Action colors (temporary branding)
blue-400: '#60a5fa',    // Cast actions
green-400: '#4ade80',   // Create actions  
purple-400: '#c084fc',  // Library actions
orange-400: '#fb923c',  // Browse actions
```

*Note: Final color palette will be established during branding phase.*

**Component Variants:**
- Dark action cards with colored borders and subtle hover animations
- Color-coded sections with high contrast accessibility
- Responsive grid systems optimized for dark backgrounds
